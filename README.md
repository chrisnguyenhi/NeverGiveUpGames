<br>
I contacted NeverGiveUpGames regarding this order going beyond the EDD (Estimated Delivery Date). <br>
From the conversation, I have concluded the following: <br>
- The seller REFUSES to refund me any amount. <br>
- The seller says the cards are on the way but has NO PROOF OR TRACKING INFORMATION to confirm that the cards are enroute. <br>
- The seller DODGES every request or opportunity to refund me when asked. <br>
<br>

Below is my full message history with the seller. <br>
This should be read bottom-up as the latest messages are on top. <br>
I will continue to make updates as this issue evolves. <br>
